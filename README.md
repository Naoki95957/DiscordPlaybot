# DiscordPlaybot
First attempt at a discord bot in python. 

Not very pretty, but functional and hopefully useful

The bots purpose is to allow community to ping roles where you would alternatively have individuals pinging roles.
The latter is favored so that no one individual could possibly spam notifications on a channel.

Bot's primariy control is via Discord but can be controlled with a back-door terminal

You can install req. files with:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will need to set up .env file:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=secret_token
BOT_ID=bot_id
MY_ID=personal_user_id
```
