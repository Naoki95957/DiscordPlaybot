# DiscordPlaybot
First attempt at a discord bot in python. 

Not very pretty, but functional and hopefully useful

Bot's primariy control is via Discord but can be controlled with a back-door terminal

You can install req. files with:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will need to set up .env file:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=secret_token
BOT_ID=bot_id
MY_ID=personal_user_id
```
